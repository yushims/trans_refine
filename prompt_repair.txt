Return ONLY one strict JSON value (no markdown/prose) that is a corrected version of previous_output.
Do NOT change semantic content except as required to make it valid JSON and satisfy the schema below.

Schema (provided by caller; treat as authoritative):
{target_schema}

Repair rules:
- Remove any non-JSON text (including markdown/code fences) outside the JSON value.
- Output MUST be exactly one JSON value (object/array/string/number/boolean/null) matching the schema.
- Quote keys/strings properly; escape quotes/newlines; use valid UTF-8.
- Remove trailing commas; fix mismatched brackets/braces; ensure proper separators.
- If required fields are missing, add them using schema-consistent safe defaults:
  - object: missing required properties → add with default if given, else empty/zero/false/null as type-appropriate
  - array: missing → []
  - string: missing → ""
  - number: missing → 0
  - integer: missing → 0
  - boolean: missing → false
  - null: missing → null
- If a field has the wrong type, coerce to the required type when unambiguous; otherwise replace with a safe default.
- Drop any keys/properties not allowed by the schema (e.g., when additionalProperties=false or when keys must match exactly).
- If the schema specifies constraints (min/max, enum/const, required, minItems, patterns), modify only as needed to satisfy them.
- Ensure the final output parses as JSON and conforms to the schema.
